## Usage

### Browsing Courses

The main page displays all available courses:

```
1. View the course list on the homepage
2. Click any course card to view details
3. Each course shows completion status with a checkmark (✅)
```

### Viewing Course Details

Access detailed information about any course:

```
1. Click on a course from the main list
2. View course description and complete lesson list
3. See progress status at the bottom
4. Use "Back to Courses" to return to main list
```

### Tracking Progress

Mark courses as completed:

```
1. Open any course detail page
2. Review all lessons
3. Click "Mark as Completed" button

5. Course marked with ✅ in main list
```

## Application Components

### Part 1: Course List View
- Displays all available courses
- Shows completion status for each course
- Interactive cards with hover effects
- Click navigation to course details

### Part 2: Course Detail View
- Detailed course information display
- Complete lesson listing
- Back navigation to course list
- Progress tracking display

### Part 3: Interaction Management
- Course completion toggle
- Navigation state management
- Dynamic UI updates
- Event handling for all interactions

### Part 4: Data Structure
- Course data model with lessons array
- Completion status tracking
- In-memory state management
- Sample course content included

## Default Course Content

The platform includes three sample courses:

1. **Introduction to Python**
   - 5 lessons covering Python basics
   - Topics: installation, variables, control flow, functions, projects

2. **Web Development with HTML & CSS**
   - 5 lessons on modern web development
   - Topics: HTML basics, CSS fundamentals, layouts, responsive design, deployment

3. **JavaScript Essentials**
   - 5 lessons on JavaScript fundamentals
   - Topics: syntax, DOM manipulation, events, interactive pages

## Customization

### Adding New Courses

Edit the `courses` array in the JavaScript section:

```javascript
const courses = [
  {
    id: 4,  // Unique ID
    title: "Your Course Title",
    description: "Course description here",
    lessons: [
      "Lesson 1 Title",
      "Lesson 2 Title",
      // Add more lessons
    ],
    completed: false
  }
];
```

### Styling Customization

Modify the CSS variables in the `<style>` section:

```css
/* Change primary color */
header {
  background-color: #your-color;
}

/* Adjust card styling */
li {
  border-radius: 8px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
}
```

### Adding Features

The code is structured for easy extension:

- Add lesson completion tracking
- Implement video/content embedding
- Add user authentication
- Create quiz functionality
- Add progress bars

## Testing

### Quick Test

Open the file and verify:

```
✓ All three courses display on homepage
✓ Course cards are clickable
✓ Course detail page shows correctly
✓ Back button returns to course list
✓ Mark as completed button works
✓ Completion status persists during session
✓ Checkmarks appear on completed courses
```

### Browser Compatibility Test

Test in multiple browsers:

```
✓ Chrome/Chromium
✓ Firefox
✓ Safari
✓ Edge
✓ Mobile browsers (responsive design)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Page doesn't load properly**
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled in your browser
- Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console)
- Verify the HTML file is not corrupted

**2. Styling looks broken**
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- Ensure CSS is not being blocked by extensions
- Try a different browser to isolate the issue

**3. Buttons not responding**
- Check JavaScript console for errors
- Ensure no browser extensions are interfering
- Verify file is being served correctly (not blocked by security)

**4. Completion status not saving**
- Note: Current version uses in-memory storage only
- Status resets on page reload
- For persistent storage, implement localStorage (see enhancement tips)

### Enhancement Tips

**Add Persistent Storage:**
```javascript
// Save to localStorage
function saveCourses() {
  localStorage.setItem('courses', JSON.stringify(courses));
}

// Load from localStorage
function loadCourses() {
  const saved = localStorage.getItem('courses');
  if (saved) return JSON.parse(saved);
  return courses; // fallback to default
}
```

**Make Responsive:**
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  main {
    padding: 0 0.5rem;
  }
  li {
    padding: 0.75rem;
  }
}
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Lightweight**: < 10KB total file size
- **No HTTP Requests**: All resources inline
- **Fast Load Time**: Instant loading on modern browsers
- **No Build Process**: Works immediately without compilation
- **Scalability**: Suitable for 10-50 courses without performance issues

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Features
- User authentication and profiles
- Course progress bars (lesson-level completion)
- Video and multimedia content embedding
- Quiz and assessment functionality
- Certificate generation upon completion
- Search and filter capabilities
- Course categories and tags
- User reviews and ratings
- Backend API integration
- Database storage for user progress

### Scalability Considerations
- Implement pagination for large course lists
- Add lazy loading for lesson content
- Create separate JavaScript modules
- Use a frontend framework (React, Vue) for complex features
- Add backend API for user data persistence
